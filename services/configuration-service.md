# Configuration Service

{% hint style="info" %}
_**This service has not yet been implemented**_.

This is expected to take the form from the `shared-services-experiment` from using `etcd` for the [configuration service](https://github.com/libero/shared-services-experiment/tree/master/configuration) and a script for the [side-car](https://github.com/libero/shared-services-experiment/tree/master/side-configuration).
